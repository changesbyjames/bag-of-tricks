I'm going to be following this tutorial, which I've heard great things about, but in React & react-three-fiber rather than vanilla JS. So there's a translation problem solving as we go.

I'm keeping track of the process I'm making in this repo: [https://github.com/changesbyjames/three-js-journey](https://github.com/changesbyjames/three-js-journey)

And an overview of the project here: [3d.lemonade.fy](https://3d.lemonade.fy).
