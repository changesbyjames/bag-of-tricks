Graphs with nodes, edges & dependancies are one of those concepts that you learn and then start seeing everywhere, almost to an “everything looks like a nail” extent. That being said, a simple and powerful way to visualise them is always useful. React Flow seems to be a great library to do this that can scale from a static layout of nodes to a full interactive, animated and editable graph.

Specifically, I’m thinking this would be a great tool to display dependancies within a system to visualise traffic, requests and errors. Get an idea of health at a glance.
